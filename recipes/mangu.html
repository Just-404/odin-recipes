    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Mangu is the most popular plantain-based dish in the Dominican Republic. It's a traditional Dominican breakfast/dinner recipe, which consists of a creamy, smooth plantain mash, accompanied with eggs and a type of sausage called salami. 
        If you try it for the first time, you won't regret it.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe plantains</li>
        <li>1Â½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter or olive oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the plantains, cut lengthwise, and then divide each half into two.</li>
        <li>Place the plantains and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook 20 minutes, until plantains are tender but slightly firm.</li>
        <li>Remove the plantains from the water and mash them right away with a fork until they are very smooth and there are few to no lumps.</li>
        <li>Finally, mix in butter, and progressively add a cup of water at room temperature and keep mashing and mixing until it turns into a very smooth puree.</li>
        <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> For full experience serve with eggs and salami.</li>
    </ol>
