    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Dominican spaghetti can shock many foreigners who have never tried it before because it's a dish that break some rules (Italians, please don't kill us :c).
    </p>

    <p>Spaghetti a la Dominicana is a traditional Dominican dish made with Dominican salami, a tomato sauce with vegetables, and –in some homes– evaporated milk. It's a very <em>interesting</em> dish, so I encourage anybody to try it along some "tostones" or better known as fried plantains.</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pound Dominican "salami"</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 red onion, large diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup pitted green olives</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>4 plum tomato, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon oregano (dry, ground)</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup evaporated milk, (optional)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon pepper (freshly-cracked, or ground), or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Boil the spaghetti in enough water to cover them (about 2 liters) until they are slightly softer than <em>al dente</em>, having added 1 tablespoon of salt to the boiling water (set aside remaining salt). Then 
        drain the water and set the spaghetti aside.</li>
       <li><strong>Cook the sauce</strong>. While the spaghetti is boiling, heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Then cut the salami into cubes. Fry and stir the salami until it browns.</li>
       <li>Lower heat to medium-low and add onions, olives, garlic, and capers and stir for a minute or until onions become translucent. </li>  
       <li>Add tomatoes, simmer covered until the tomatoes are cooked through (3-5 mins). Stir in tomato sauce to mix.</li>
       <li>Add milk and the sauce to the boiled spaghetti and mix well. First stir until the milk is mixed through, but do not let it boil or the milk will curdle.</li>
       <li>Season it with black pepper and salt to taste.</li>
       <li>Serve hot and garnish with cheese.  </li>
    </ol>
