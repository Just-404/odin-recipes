    </ol>

    <i>To assemble</i>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the plantains and boil adding 1 teaspoon of salt to the water. Once the plantains are fork tender for 15-20 mins. Then remove them from the heat.</li>
        <li>Drain the water right away, and mash them with a fork. Add the butter and keep mashing until it is very smooth with no lumps. </li>
        <li>Layer the ingredients. Grease a 1-inch tall baking pan. Put half of the plantain mixture in the baking pan. Then cover with half of the cheese.
